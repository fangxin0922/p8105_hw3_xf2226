# Problem 1

``` r
data("instacart")

instacart <- instacart %>% 
    mutate(
      order_dow = order_dow + 1,
      order_dow = wday(order_dow, label = T)
   ) 
```

## A short description of the dataset, noting the size and structure of the data, describing some key variables

This instacart dataset contains 1384617 rows and 15 columns.

The observations are orders which is included in the `order_id` column.
We have 131209 order in total. Within those orders, there are 39123
unique products. Some examples of the products include Bulgarian Yogurt,
Organic 4% Milk Fat Whole Milk Cottage Cheese, Organic Celery Hearts,
Cucumber Kirby, Lightly Smoked Sardines in Olive Oil. Those products are
coming from 134 unique aisles and 21 departments. The top two days of
the week where the most orders are placed is Sat, Sun, which are the
weekends.

Some key varaibles are:

-   `order_id`= order identifier
-   `product_id`= product identifier
-   `user_id`= customer identifier
-   `order_number`= the order sequence number for this user (1=first,
    n=nth)
-   `order_dow`= the day of the week on which the order was placed
-   `product_name`= name of the product
-   `aisle_id`= aisle identifier
-   `aisle`= the name of the aisle
-   `department_id`= department identifier
-   `department`= the name of the department

## Illstrative examples of observations

``` r
instacart_dow_dept <- instacart %>% 
  filter(department == "produce" | department == "frozen") %>% 
  group_by(order_dow, aisle, department) %>% 
  summarise(total = n())

instacart_dow_dept %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = order_dow, y = total, group = aisle, color = aisle)) + 
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(department ~ ., scales = "free_y") +
   labs(
    x = "Day of the Week",
    y = "Quantity of Orders",
  )
```

## Problem 1.1

How many aisles, and which are most items from?

``` r
aisles <- instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

There are 134 number of aisles. The top 3 aisles where most items are
ordered are from fresh vegetables, fresh fruits, packaged vegetables
fruits

## Problem 1.2

Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

``` r
aisles %>%
  filter(n > 10000) %>% 
  mutate(
    aisle = factor(aisle),
    aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)
  ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) + geom_point() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 270, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1)) + 
  labs(
    y = "number of items ordered", 
    title = "Number of items ordered from each aisle (that has more than 10000 items ordered)"
  )
```

## Problem 1.3

Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the aisles
“baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables fruits”.
Include the number of times each item is ordered in your table.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  count(product_name) %>% 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>% 
  filter(rank < 4) %>% #top three popular items
  arrange(aisle, rank) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product\_name                                 |    n | rank |
|:---------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|-----:|-----:|
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |  499 |    1 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |  387 |    2 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |  336 |    3 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |   30 |    1 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |   28 |    2 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |   26 |    3 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |    3 |

## Problem 1.4

Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady Apples
and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week; format this
table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).

``` r
instacart %>% 
    filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>% 
    group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>% 
    summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>% #taking mean hour of the day
    pivot_wider(
        names_from = order_dow,
        values_from = mean_hour
    )
```

    ## # A tibble: 2 × 8
    ## # Groups:   product_name [2]
    ##   product_name       Sun   Mon   Tue   Wed   Thu   Fri   Sat
    ##   <chr>            <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
    ## 1 Coffee Ice Cream  13.8  14.3  15.4  15.3  15.2  12.3  13.8
    ## 2 Pink Lady Apples  13.4  11.4  11.7  14.2  11.6  12.8  11.9

# Problem 2

## load and clean BRFSS dataset

``` r
data("brfss_smart2010")
brfss_smart2010 <- brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() 

brfss <- brfss_smart2010 %>%  
  filter(topic %in% "Overall Health") %>%
  filter(response %in% c("Poor","Fair","Good","Very good","Excellent")) %>%
  mutate(response = factor(response, ordered = TRUE, 
                       levels = c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very good", "Excellent")),
         locationdesc = gsub('^.{0,5}', '', locationdesc)) %>% 
  rename(state = locationabbr, county = locationdesc)
```

## Problem 2.1:

In 2002, which states were observed at 7 or more locations? What about
in 2010?

``` r
states_2002 <- brfss %>% 
  filter(year == 2002) %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  summarise(n_state = n()) %>% 
  filter(n_state > 6)

states_2010 <- brfss %>% 
  filter(year == 2010) %>% 
  group_by(state) %>% 
  summarise(n_state = n()) %>% 
  filter(n_state > 6)
```

In 2002, the states that were observed at 7 or more locations are AZ,
CO, CT, DE, FL, GA, HI, ID, IL, IN, KS, LA, MA, MD, ME, MI, MN, MO, NC,
NE, NH, NJ, NV, NY, OH, OK, OR, PA, RI, SC, SD, TN, TX, UT, VT, WA.  
In 2010, the states that were observed at 7 or more locations are AL,
AR, AZ, CA, CO, CT, DE, FL, GA, HI, IA, ID, IL, IN, KS, LA, MA, MD, ME,
MI, MN, MO, MS, MT, NC, ND, NE, NH, NJ, NM, NV, NY, OH, OK, OR, PA, RI,
SC, SD, TN, TX, UT, VT, WA, WY.

## Problem 2.2

Construct a dataset that is limited to Excellent responses, and
contains, year, state, and a variable that averages the data\_value
across locations within a state. Make a “spaghetti” plot of this average
value over time within a state (that is, make a plot showing a line for
each state across years – the geom\_line geometry and group aesthetic
will help).

``` r
brfss %>% 
  filter(response == "Excellent") %>% 
  group_by(state, year) %>%  
  mutate(
    data_value_ave = mean(data_value, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>% 
  select(year, state, data_value_ave) %>% 
  unique() %>% 
  ggplot(
    aes(x = year, y = data_value_ave, group = state, color = state)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  labs(
    x = "Average Data Value"
  )
```

![](p8105_hw3_xf2226_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png)<!-- -->

## Problem 2.3

Make a two-panel plot showing, for the years 2006, and 2010,
distribution of data\_value for responses (“Poor” to “Excellent”) among
locations in NY State.

``` r
brfss %>% 
  filter(year == "2006" | year == "2010", state == "NY") %>% 
  select(year, data_value, response) %>%
  ggplot(
    aes(x = data_value, color = response)) + 
  geom_density() + 
  facet_grid(.~ year) +
  labs(
    x = "Data Value"
  )
```

# Problem 3

## load and tidy accelerometer dataset

``` r
accel <- read_csv("./data/accel_data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() 

accel_cleaned <- accel %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = activity_1:activity_1440,
    names_to = "activity_min", 
    values_to = "activity_count"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    activity_min = gsub("^.{0,9}", "", activity_min), 
    day = factor(day, ordered = TRUE, 
                  levels = c("Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday")), 
    activity_min = as.numeric(activity_min), 
    day_of_week = as.factor(ifelse(day %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday"), "weekend", "weekday"))
  ) %>% 
  select(week, day_id, day, day_of_week, activity_min, activity_count)
```

This cleaned accelerometer dataset contains 50400 observations and 6
variables.

Some key varaibles are:

-   `week`= week of the observation
-   `day_id`= day of the observation
-   `day`= day of the week of the observation
-   `activity_min`= min of the observation
-   `activity_count`= activity counts for each minute
-   `day_of_week`= what is weekday vs. weekend

## Problem 3.1

Traditional analyses of accelerometer data focus on the total activity
over the day. Using your tidied dataset, aggregate accross minutes to
create a total activity variable for each day, and create a table
showing these totals. Are any trends apparent?

``` r
accel_cleaned %>% 
  group_by(week, day) %>% 
  summarize(total_activity = sum(activity_count)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = day,
    values_from = total_activity
  ) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 1)
```

| week | Sunday | Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday | Saturday |
|-----:|-------:|-------:|--------:|----------:|---------:|-------:|---------:|
|    1 | 631105 |  78828 |  307094 |    340115 |   355924 | 480543 |   376254 |
|    2 | 422018 | 295431 |  423245 |    440962 |   474048 | 568839 |   607175 |
|    3 | 467052 | 685910 |  381507 |    468869 |   371230 | 467420 |   382928 |
|    4 | 260617 | 409450 |  319568 |    434460 |   340291 | 154049 |     1440 |
|    5 | 138421 | 389080 |  367824 |    445366 |   549658 | 620860 |     1440 |

I did not see any apparent trend. However, Saturday for week 4 and 5
have significantly less activity count compared to any other days of the
study period. We need to look more in-depth about those two days and see
if some serious measurement errors occurred

## Problem 3.2

Accelerometer data allows the inspection activity over the course of the
day. Make a single-panel plot that shows the 24-hour activity time
courses for each day and use color to indicate day of the week. Describe
in words any patterns or conclusions you can make based on this graph.

``` r
accel_cleaned %>%
  mutate(hour = activity_min/60) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = hour, y = activity_count, group = day_id)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = day)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(color = day, group = day))  +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 24)) +
  labs(
    x = "Hour of the day",
    y = "Accelerometer activity count", 
    title = '24-hour activity time courses for each day'
  ) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1), plot.title = element_text(size = 11))
```
